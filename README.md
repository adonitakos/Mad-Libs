# Mad-Libs

The following is just a simple Mad-Libs I wrote using Python.
I originally wrote this in Java, however, I switched this mini-project to Python due to its simpler methods to read data but also .format() module.

Currently there are two game examples to choose from, but there will be more examples to add in the future.
